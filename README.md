## Hi there :)

It's tough to write something attention-grabbing about myself, but here I go, making my attempt anyway...

I am currently in doing my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science.

Here are my current skills:
* Python
* MySQL
  * numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn,
* C
* bash
* Dart
* MATLAB

Here are the skills I want to develop in the future:
* Operating Systems
* Java
* HTML, CSS, JS,
* Linux kernel modules
* Verilog, TL-Verilog
* Computer Networkong
* Compiler Design

All my social media handles relavant to tech can be found in the sidebar. (Except [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Srisha).)

I am a technology enthusiast who loves tinkering, exploring and breaking things. But off-late I have embraced the process of creation too.
(Ignore my username btw, I'm too lazy to change it..)
